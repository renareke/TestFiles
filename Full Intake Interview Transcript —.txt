Full Intake Interview Transcript — Gemma & Paul

Paul began the conversation by asking Gemma to share the details of the professionals involved in her family member’s care. He requested information about consultants, public health nurses, GPs, and any other professionals, including their names, job titles, contact information, and the reasons for their involvement.

Gemma explained that their GP is Dr. Jones, based at Carrigg Medical Center. Their public health nurse, Caroline Kiely, is also located at the same center. Their surgeon is Dr. Raffi, who is based at CUH, and they receive some rehabilitation support from a team at Temple Street.

Paul asked whether there had been any changes or updates regarding the professionals involved. Gemma answered that things had remained stable since the accident. They had discussed possibly consulting another surgeon, but nothing had been confirmed.

Paul then requested an overview of the family member's medical history. Gemma responded that there wasn't much to highlight for Imogen specifically, but her husband has asthma and a peanut allergy, which requires an EpiPen. Their son is currently undergoing hearing tests.

Paul followed up by asking if there had been any medical updates since their last conversation. Gemma confirmed that there hadn’t been any changes.

Next, Paul asked whether Imogen had experienced seizures, had a shunt, feeding issues, tracheostomy, or additional learning needs. Gemma replied that none of these applied. She explained that Imogen had been in a wheelchair for a while but was now transitioning to using crutches, hopefully.

Paul moved on to medication and asked what Imogen was currently taking. After a moment of struggling to recall, Gemma clarified that Imogen was on a significant amount of pain relief, including Calpol and Neurofen, as well as doctor-prescribed medication. When she had been in the rehab centre, she was also taking medication related to catheterisation, though that had since been reduced as her condition improved.

Paul then asked about allergies within the family. Gemma confirmed that her husband has a severe peanut allergy and carries an EpiPen. Her son has some food intolerances, but Imogen has never shown any signs of allergies.

Paul asked who lived at home with Imogen and requested details about each person. Gemma explained that she had previously been working, but since Imogen's accident, she was now a full-time caregiver at home for both Imogen and her son. Her husband Billy is around occasionally, but his job takes him away often, which Gemma admitted was frustrating. Imogen is five years old, and it's been about a year since her trampoline accident that caused spinal cord damage. Jude, Imogen’s little brother, is three years old and goes to nursery, while Imogen is currently not attending school.

Paul asked whether Gemma foresaw anything in the coming year that might cause stress. Gemma confessed that her husband was driving her "bananas" because of how much he works away, which leaves her alone with Imogen most of the time. She admitted uncertainty about whether they would stay together and noted that if they were to separate, she might ask her mum to move in for support.

Paul expressed sympathy and asked whether anyone outside the household was offering her support. Gemma replied that her mum was a huge help, though her mother-in-law hadn’t been much help, which was part of the arguments she was having with her husband. She also mentioned that after Imogen’s accident, friends had drifted away, and that she rarely saw anyone because she needed to stay with Imogen, who was also acting out, likely from frustration.

Paul asked how confident she was in her financial situation, on a scale from one to five. Gemma said it was "all right," though losing her income had caused financial strain. Her husband still earned a decent salary, but she was worried about the future, especially if they were to separate. She noted she was on the primary carer allowance, which helped but was means-tested, and described the situation as a pinch point.

Paul inquired about other health or social care services the family might be using. Gemma explained they engaged with Enable Ireland, which offered some social participation opportunities, but noted there was a gap in services specific to Imogen’s injury.

Paul then asked about the specific challenges Imogen was facing and what services they hoped to access from the Crann Centre. Gemma explained that her priority was for Imogen to regain social connections, as she was no longer in school and had few chances to make friends. Above all, she wanted to see Imogen move from her wheelchair to crutches and eventually walk unaided. She was also interested in counselling for both herself and her husband, whether separately or together, as she felt her husband was using work as an excuse to avoid the situation. Additionally, she admitted that she hadn't been as attentive to Jude, given the circumstances, and hoped for support for him too.

Paul asked if there were any developmental or social concerns for Imogen before the accident. Gemma said that Imogen had reached all her milestones without issues, though her teacher had suggested extra social sessions and there had been some talk of ADHD testing before the accident. Since the accident, all focus had shifted to her physical recovery.

Paul moved on to questions about independent living. He asked Gemma to rate her confidence in managing Imogen's daily activities like feeding, bathing, dressing, bedtime, and playtime. Gemma said her own confidence was a five, as she knew exactly what Imogen needed, but Imogen’s own ability was now more like a two. She explained that although Imogen could feed herself, she couldn’t bathe or dress independently, and mobility was a significant limitation.

When asked about goals for independent living services, Gemma emphasized that, although Imogen was only five and wouldn't be living independently for a while, her long-term goal was to help her daughter regain mobility so she could eventually lead a normal life.

Paul asked about concerns related to diet, pressure sores, continence, and training. Gemma said their nurse had mentioned pressure sore training, but no formal training had been provided yet. She also expressed worry over Imogen’s eating habits, saying that since the accident, Imogen was eating more sweets, often brought by visitors, and was putting on weight due to reduced mobility. Gemma was looking for help on feeding her healthy food.

Regarding continence, Gemma said that Imogen had used a catheter while in the rehab centre but no longer did. She was now back in nappies at night, which was frustrating since she had previously been potty trained. Daytime continence was fine, but nighttime remained an issue. She rated their confidence in managing continence as a three.

Paul asked about mobility and whether Imogen could walk or transfer independently. Gemma replied that Imogen could sometimes get herself out of bed or the wheelchair but mostly relied on Gemma to lift her. They didn’t use a hoist. She noted they had contacted the Irish Wheelchair Association but hadn’t heard back and that she was especially interested in Crann’s "Skills on Wheels" program to help Imogen learn better wheelchair skills. Still, her ultimate goal was to help Imogen walk again, so occupational therapy support was a priority.

Paul asked how confident Gemma felt about Imogen managing her own mobility. Gemma answered two, explaining that Imogen was very dependent on her and still enjoying that dependence.

When asked if they were interested in mobility services like transfer training, upper limb rehab, and occupational therapy, Gemma confirmed and reiterated her focus on getting Imogen walking again, though she was also interested in wheelchair skills for the short term.

Paul then asked about Imogen’s mental health and any changes in behaviour since the accident. Gemma described Imogen as being more moody, sometimes enjoying the attention from her and at other times feeling frustrated about being unable to play with friends or return to school. She admitted that family arguments with her husband were affecting everyone’s moods. She rated Imogen's psychological well-being at two, and her own the same.

Paul offered information about psychological services available, including counselling, stress management, reflexology, and play therapy, and asked if Gemma was interested. Gemma responded that play therapy would be helpful for Imogen, and counselling might be needed for herself and her husband, though she wasn’t sure whether individually or together. She was also open to reflexology if it could offer Imogen some relief.

Paul shifted the topic to education, asking about Imogen's school status. Gemma said that Imogen was still enrolled at Educate Together in Carrigaline but wasn’t attending due to her injury. The school had offered to send materials, but Gemma wanted her to focus on recovery first. She didn’t feel education was relevant at the moment.

Paul asked her to rate her confidence in Imogen’s educational progress for the next year. Gemma declined to answer, as she felt school wasn’t on her radar at all right now.

Paul then asked about the family’s social network and connections. Gemma said her mother was her rock and best friend during this time. She’d lost touch with friends, as her focus was fully on Imogen. Jude still attended Little Kickers, but Imogen could no longer go to ballet classes. Socialising was definitely a challenge.

Paul asked her to rate their social connections. Gemma rated it a three.

Paul offered information about Crann’s social capital services, like support groups, youth clubs, holiday camps, and peer networks. Gemma said she would definitely be interested.

Finally, Paul summarised the service areas Crann could help with: independent living, health and continence, mobility, psychological well-being, education and career pathways, and social capital. He asked Gemma to rank them by importance.

Gemma listed mobility as the highest priority, followed by psychological well-being, and then social connections. The other areas were lower priority.
